# Problem Statement: 
Develop an intelligent and efficient model to
recommend customized discounts for customers based on their business
significance and performance

# Case study: 
It is estimated that the CPG and retail industry accounts for
more than half of the worldâ€™s GDP. Discounts , promotions and pricing
strategies drive a major portion of the revenue to the Companies.
Hence, it becomes very important for these companies to provide
discounts by looking at the ROI of the complete discount profile of the
customer. Running a promotion or giving a discount can, when done
properly, deliver incremental sale or help gaining access to new
customers. Discounts can be of various types: Discount generated per
purchase, discounts based on agreements,
Discounts in the form of commercial Investments on our customers to
match the market incentives, trade promotions offered to consumers to
increase market share.
We need you to develop a solution, identify distribution patterns and
optimize different types of discounts given to customers to maximize
1 profit.

# How it impacts or helps the business and why are we solving it?
Discounts are one the primary ways to incentivise the customers and boost the market share. The discounts that we provide to the customers should be optimised
in such a way that it should maximise the ROI.
Currently, there is very less visibility on the overall discount-investment profile of the customer and hence there is a need to have an intelligent discount
recommender in place to increase revenue by providing optimised discounts.
